# Overview

This assignment asks you to develop a software replica of the Enigma encryption machine used by the German military in World War II. Efforts to break the Enigma cipher led to the development of the first electronic computers at Bletchley Park, England. Using computers, the Allies were eventually able to break the Enigma code, giving them an intelligence edge that changed the balance of the war. The most famous of those computers is the Bombe, which was designed by Alan Turing (pictured to the right). Turing is arguably the founder of modern computer science.
